# Introduction

We need to deprecate a rare usage of `_` as an identifier in C++ 20 so it can
be safely used for pattern matching [@P1371R1] which is targeting C++ 23. The
issue is simple, we'd like structured binding code as in,

```c++
auto [a, _] = std::make_pair(3, 4);
```

, to have `_` represent a wildcard pattern instead of binding the identifier
`_`. There are a few ways to do this and we suggest what we think is the ideal
engineering approach.

# Various Approaches

## Use something besides '`_`' (BAD)

Why is `_` so important? '`?`' is available. Languages with pattern
matching almost universally use `_` as a wildcard pattern and popular libraries
in C++ (like Google Test) do the same. It would be ackward and somewhat
embarrasing if C++ were to not use the conventional token. Furthermore, because
`_` has so much existing widespread use, we expect people to use `_` anyway,
and accidentily bind the `_` identifier.

`__` is another possiblility, but it is difficult to recognize as a double
underscore with many fonts and we expect significant confusion were we to use
this.

## Deprecate all or most uses of '`_`' as an identifier (WORSE)

Another option is to deprecate all or most uses of `_` as an identifier. We could,
for instance, deprecate block-scope references to `_` identifiers. The
migration cost for this is unfortunately quite a steep one. There are more
instances of the `_` token than `short` in the wild [@ACTCD16]. Breaking all
this code would be costly for the C++ community so other options are preferred.

## Deprecate '`_`' access when structured-binding bound (OKAY)

Finally, we could deprecate referencing `_` identifiers that are bound as
part of a structured binding. Because structured binding is a relatively new
feature and most uses of `_` as a structured binding identifier are expected to
be wildcard uses anyway, the cost of fixing breakages would be low.
This change to be a sweet spot for engineering value, but we need to act
quickly if we want to take advantage of this for pattern matching in C++23.

# Should we generalize this as in P1110R0?

[@P1110R0] suggests that we make something like the wildcard (`_`) pattern
accessible in many other places than patterns (e.g. in an enumerator). The
authors of this paper find questionable engineering value for many of these
suggestions and have no opinion on others. Our primary focus is on parity
between structured bindings and pattern matching.

# Conclusion

Right now we have an opportunity to prevent mistakes being made by using the
wildcard that everyone expects for pattern matching. Lets deprecate access to
`_` variables if they are bound by structured binding.
